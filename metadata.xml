    <description>This mod adds a few new funky items to the game:

- Eye of the Subconscious: Isaac stops being able to fire manually and will fire like Demon Baby. (Devil Deal Pool)
- Remote Control: Bombs move in the direction of Isaac's tears. (Shop Pool)
- Bleeding Edge Tech: Technology that is aimed towards Isaac's moving familiars. (Item Room Pool)
- Action Worm: Moldable Worm type item. (Item Room Pool)

If you want to check them out in action, check out the video. I'll be adding more items as I come up with more cool ideas to add.</description>
