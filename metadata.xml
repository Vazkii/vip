    <description>This mod adds a few new funky items to the game:

- Eye of the Subconscious: Isaac stops being able to fire manually and will fire like Demon Baby.
- Remote Control: Bombs move in the direction of Isaac's tears.
- Bleeding Edge Tech: Technology that is aimed towards Isaac's moving familiars.
- Action Worm: Moldable Worm type item.

If you want to check them out in action, check out the video. I'll be adding more items as I come up with more cool ideas to add.

Currently these do not spawn properly as there doesn't appear to be a way to get them in the item pools. You'll need to give them via the debug console.</description>
